# Consulting 101

## Lesson 1: You can only help people who want to be helped.
No amount of “but they need my advice!” results in you getting paid for your advice. People must want the help.

## Lesson 2: Consulting is a relationship business.
You will spend more time than you expect building relationships. Those may turn into a deal the following week, the following year, or never.
## Lesson 3: Consulting is about providing advice, not doing-a-thing.
If you’re hands-on-keyboard, the most valuable asset you have (what you know) is going to be wasted.

## Lesson 4: You want a dozen clients, not three.
If you have one client, you just have a job by another name. A dozen clients is a business. Your risk is spread around and one client leaving impacts you not-at-all.

## Lesson 5: You want short, concise engagements, not long, “whatever you got for me” engagements.
Getting through engagements quickly allows you to become an expert in your area faster. It requires you get good at a marketing+sales machine, though.

## Lesson 6: You are your best sales person.
You are the product. If you can’t sell engagements well, no one else will be able to either. You can’t outsource sales the way you’re probably hoping. Selling yourself must be a core competency.

## Lesson 7: Consulting sales is relationship-building, not ads.
The vast majority of your work will come by referrals, especially in the early days. Facebook/Google/LinkedIn/whatever ads are not how solo consultancies consistently get clients.

## Lesson 8: Teach everything you know.
A body of work to point to is an incredibly compelling sales pitch. Don’t worry about giving away too much. Clients hire consultants to apply those things to their unique situation.

## Lesson 9: Fuck you, pay me.
But generally don’t give private, situation-specific advice for free.

## Lesson 10: The vast majority of those reading this shouldn’t be consultants.
It’s not always easy, and if you’re a capable engineer, taking an FTE job is way easier. Becoming a consultant is not a quick path to riches, particularly for software engineers.

## Lesson 11: Get comfortable with your advice not being used.
You can lead a client to water but you can’t make them drink. Sometimes your job isn’t what you think it is

## LAST BUT NOT LEAST
Either consult on a single *very specific* problem (and do lots of engagements on it) or go be an FTE(FTE = Full Time Employee).
A consultant who is a generalist is the worst of all worlds.
