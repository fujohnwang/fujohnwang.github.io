Before The Company I worked for put its office in High Tech Zone, we have been working for about 6 months in Tian'An Building which is located at Qing Ni Wa Bridge. Just a few days before we leave, I took these pictures in the hall of the bulding for memory. I love the tree behind me, it's so beautiful. The other two guys in the photos are Mi linpeng and Wen yi. Since Mi Lin peng's family name is Mi, usually I will call him "DaMi",you know , the song"老鼠爱大米“ is so popular those days,hehe ,but I am not that mouse...

These photos is taken on my way home, I went home by ship from Dalian to Yantai, you can find sea birds in the pictures and the ocean. The guys who asked me whether it is funny to go travel by ship will also find that it is not funny, because you can see nothing but the few sea birds and the sea water. You will find no people , no hill , even no island ,hehe ,except when the ship drows near the port.

Everytime I saw him, I will remember LuXun(鲁迅)'s story on his childhood buddy. As  a same , We have few words to talk now, but everytime I go home, he will come for me and talk for somthing. At least, I will play PC games with him,hehe, Still we have fun...
