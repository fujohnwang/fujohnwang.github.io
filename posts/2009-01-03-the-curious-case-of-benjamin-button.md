% 返老还童(The Curious Case of Benjamin Button)

> 2014年从msn space存档中重新恢复出来！

It's such a long movie, it starts dull, but believe me, you should watch this movie.

I am so glad I didn't quit when I thought it was a dull movie. Benjamin Button's life, a so different life, but I don't think it's a life so different to us, I just thougt, what my life will be when that time comes?!

Just like the song "**In The End**" from Linkin Part ^[it's a rock music which I like most, so u people still think the rock music meaningless, ha?], "but in the end, it doesn't matter"? I should leave something behind! But I am scared to this mind...why I am so confused recently? oh, maybe confused all the time.

看了，我都看的感动的哭了，大龙在旁边睡得那叫一个香。里面有些台词和剧情很逗，导致美国观众数次笑场，比如说那个被雷劈了7次的老头，他讲一次观众就笑一次~~o(∩_∩)o...
