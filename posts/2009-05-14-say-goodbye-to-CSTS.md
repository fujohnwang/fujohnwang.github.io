Dear Arthur
 
  I am sorry to say that i would like to commit a resignment.
 
  Since I can't involve citi well and can't bring too much value to citi, in order to avoid to waste unnecessary resources, I have to commit this resignment.

  It's a hard decision to make, but at last this is my final decision, I hope you can understand me for this.
 
  Hope you and the whole team can achieve great success in the future.
 
Rgds
