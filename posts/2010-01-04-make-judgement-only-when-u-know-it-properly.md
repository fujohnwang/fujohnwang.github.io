When people meet something they don't know at first time, some words like "What a mess!" will come to their mind, at least this will happen to me from time to time. In fact, the things might not be a mess, the mess is in your mind, because you don't know it. So , The lession is, before you judge something, take time to get familiar with it first, after that, you can make a proper judgement.
