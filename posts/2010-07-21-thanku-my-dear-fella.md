Only the people who care about you and know well about the situations you are gonna encounter will tell you the truth and help you to stay away from the improper situations. I am so glad that I have such kind of best friend. 

Sometimes, walking alone for a long, long time will make you loss the right direction and the right path you had set before. But with such kind of friends, they will alert you when you try to break your own principle and go wrong direction.

I will step on the brake and adjust the wheel to go on with my own path and the path I deem right.
