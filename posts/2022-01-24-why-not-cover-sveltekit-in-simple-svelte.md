People on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sveltejs/comments/s9xhtz/i_wrote_a_svelte_book_as_a_20_years_backend/htsifji/) commented and asked whether I have covered SvelteKit in my [Simple Svelte](https://wfq.gumroad.com/l/simple_svelte) book, sorry, the answer is No, but I would like to talk about why.

Firstly, this is a book for beginners not for advanced developers, no matter frontend or backend, so I only cover basic and overall things about Svelte, while SvelteKit is part of whole pure Javascript stack, it's a great choice for advanced frontend/js developers,  but not for beginners, in my opinion.

Secondly, I have my own tastes on backend or web layer. As a programmer with 20+ year experiences, especially most of the time as a backend developer, I have many ways to build a backend for frontend(BFF), so let Svelte be for frontend, while I will build a backend for it in my way. If Spring/SpringBoot is too boring, then more new players pop up, Vert.x/Quarkus/Micronaut..., you name it.

Last but not the least, it doesn't mean I don't know SvelteKit or have the expertise on it if I don't mention or elaborate it, I just don't want introduce too much burden for readers to get Svelte simply.  Anyway, it's called [Simple Svelte](https://wfq.gumroad.com/l/simple_svelte), not *Expert One-on-One Svelte Design and Development*, ;0)
