		We alibaba have a
		<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Cobar</span>&#8221;</span>
		project already which does help on distributed data access, but in
		order to meet the HA and performance requirements,
		two or more servers
		are needed to make it run. Usually it's not a good choice for small
		applications which still need distributed data access abilities. Since
		the technology department of ICBU(Alibaba) requires a lightweight but
		still powerful solution on distributed data access requirement,
		CobarClient(Version) comes into the play.
	</p><p>
		CobarClient is mainly for specific usage scenarios, that's,
		distributed data access on small or modest scale database
		shardings/partitions.
		So before you decide whether to use CobarClient,
		leverage your application scenario first.
		(For Alibaba Internal, if
		CobarClient can't meet
		your needs, you can turn
		to Cobar instead.)
