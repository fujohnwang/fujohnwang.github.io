		We hope CobarClient can provide an abstraction layer to hide the
		complexity of distributed data access, also minimize the efforts to
		access
		multiple different data storage services.
	</p><p>
		We also hope to provide a consistent data access layer which can
		standardize the data access behaviors of the applications,
		and as the
		requirements and architecture evolve, more functionalities can be
		introduced into this layer, including data replication and
		synchronization, data caching, real-time index building, etc. With
		this CobarClient, the applications only need to know the concerns they
		are real care about, rather to care about what changes, how much
		changes, the left things can leave to CobarClient to take care of.
