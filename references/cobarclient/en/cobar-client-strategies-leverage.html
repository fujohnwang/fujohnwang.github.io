		The Design and Development of CobarClient can be done from
		different aspects, but we choose three solutions for it for the time
		being.

			The available
			<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Cobar</span>&#8221;</span>
			project do data access routings by parsing and analyzing SQL, so most
			of us will think it's easy to do almost same things by wrapping the
			JDBC drivers. Of course, it should work, but it takes time, long
			time.
		</p><p>
			To do things in this way, we can't just wrap or intercept
			several JDBC interfaces to make it run, we need to implement the
			whole JDBC specification, and it will take too much time on
			development and testing. 
		</p><p>
			At first, we just try to intercept serveral methods of
			<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Connection</span>&#8221;</span>
			and
			<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Statement</span>&#8221;</span>
			to get the SQL and then parse it to do left works, but several
			headaches come to bother. You will find that several methods'
			lifecycle and invocation logic will mismatch with each other, you
			will find you have to trace the method invocation sequences, you will
			also find you have to take care of all of the database metadata
			things.
		</p><p>
			You see, we do can implement a whole JDBC driver to do works like
			current
			<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Cobar</span>&#8221;</span>
			does, but it's not an easy thing with limit time frame.
		</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dal solution"></a>1.2.&nbsp;DAL(Data Access Layer) Solution</h2></div></div></div><p>
			We can do the same thing on DAL. Many benefits are avaialble,
			including that:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>we can make a standard development process;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>we can simplify the implementation of data access routing;
					</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>furthermore, if more shards or other storage services(e.g. KV
						store) are required, the applications won't need any changes,
						'cause the DAL has hidden these changes for them.</p></li></ul></div><p>
		</p><p>
			If we do use such solution on DAL, we can externalize the
			sharding strategies and rules, the routing rules can be configured in
			a consistent way(Annotation, or external XML configuration files),
			and the rules can be defined only as per the type of DO(Data Object)
			and their attributes. It's so simple and flexible, the complexity
			of
			SQL parsing is involved.
		</p><p>
			But such solution impacts too much to the current applications,
			so althought it's a good go, we can't make it run for the time being.
		</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d558e49"></a>1.3.&nbsp;The Solution That's Specific To ICBU Applications</h2></div></div></div><p>
			After thinking on multiple factors like the time frame limitation,
			the compatibility to available applications, etc, we give out a
			solution that stands between
			<a class="xref" href="#jdbc solution" title="1.1.&nbsp;JDBC API Layer Solution">JDBC API Layer Solution</a>
			and
			<a class="xref" href="#dal solution" title="1.2.&nbsp;DAL(Data Access Layer) Solution">DAL(Data Access Layer) Solution</a>
			.
		</p><p>
			We internally use iBatis to do data access, in order to
			accelerate the development process, we use SqlMapClientTemplate of
			spring framework, too. To make less impacts on current applications,
			we have to extend the SqlMapClientTemplate class, because all of the
			data access requests will be sent out by this class, and
			if we add
			routing support in it, then it can route different data
			access
			requests to their specific data shards as per the routing
			rules we
			provide.
			</p><p>
			In fact, this is indeed the solution we choose to use in the 1st
			version
			of CobarClient.
